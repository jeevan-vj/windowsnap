# WindowSnap Sleep/Wake Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Fixed
WindowSnap was stopping to work after the Mac woke up from sleep. This is a common issue with macOS accessibility applications where system sleep can cause:

1. **Lost Accessibility Permissions** - AX API connections become stale
2. **Lost Global Shortcuts** - Carbon event handlers get disconnected  
3. **Stale Window Manager State** - Window control APIs lose connection

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Sleep/Wake Notification System (`AppDelegate.swift`)
- **Sleep Detection**: Listens for `NSWorkspace.willSleepNotification`
- **Wake Detection**: Listens for `NSWorkspace.didWakeNotification` and `NSWorkspace.screensDidWakeNotification`
- **Automatic Recovery**: Triggers reinitialization 1-2 seconds after wake with delays to let system stabilize

```swift
@objc private func systemDidWake() {
    print("☀️ System woke up - reinitializing WindowSnap...")
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1.0) {
        self.reinitializeAfterWake()
    }
}
```

### 2. Smart Reinitialization System
The reinitialization process checks and fixes only what's broken:

- **Accessibility Check**: Verifies permissions are still valid
- **Shortcut Health Check**: Tests if global shortcuts are still registered
- **WindowManager Validation**: Checks if window control APIs are working
- **Selective Recovery**: Only reinitializes components that actually failed

### 3. Enhanced ShortcutManager (`ShortcutManager.swift`)
- **Health Monitoring**: `isHealthy()` method to detect if shortcuts are working
- **Smart Recovery**: `reinitializeAfterWake()` preserves existing shortcuts and re-registers them
- **Event Handler Rebuild**: Recreates Carbon event handlers that may have been lost

```swift
func reinitializeAfterWake() {
    // Store current state
    let currentShortcuts = registeredShortcuts
    let currentActions = shortcutActions
    
    // Rebuild event handler
    setupEventHandler()
    
    // Re-register all shortcuts
    // ... reregistration logic
}
```

### 4. Enhanced WindowManager (`WindowManager.swift`)
- **Accessibility Testing**: `testAccessibility()` method to verify AX API is working
- **Health Validation**: `isHealthy()` method for future enhancements
- **State Reset**: `resetAfterWake()` method for cleanup if needed

### 5. Continuous Health Monitoring
- **Periodic Checks**: Every 30 seconds, automatically checks system health
- **Proactive Recovery**: Detects and fixes issues before users notice them
- **Minimal Overhead**: Only runs checks, doesn't restart unless problems detected

```swift
private func startHealthCheck() {
    healthCheckTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 30.0, repeats: true) { [weak self] _ in
        self?.performHealthCheck()
    }
}
```

## Benefits of This Implementation

### ✅ **Automatic Recovery**
- No manual restart needed after sleep/wake
- Works silently in the background
- User never notices the interruption

### ✅ **Intelligent Detection**
- Only fixes what's actually broken
- Preserves working functionality
- Minimal system impact

### ✅ **Multiple Safety Nets**
- Immediate wake detection
- Delayed recovery for system stabilization  
- Continuous health monitoring
- Multiple wake notification types

### ✅ **Robust Error Handling**
- Graceful fallbacks if permissions are lost
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Smart retry mechanisms

### ✅ **Performance Optimized**
- Health checks only every 30 seconds
- Selective reinitialization
- No unnecessary restarts

## Testing the Fix

1. **Basic Test**: Put Mac to sleep, wake up, test shortcuts immediately
2. **Extended Test**: Sleep for hours, should still recover
3. **Health Monitoring**: Shortcuts should work consistently over time

The fix ensures WindowSnap works reliably through all sleep/wake scenarios while maintaining excellent performance and user experience.

## Files Modified

- `WindowSnap/App/AppDelegate.swift` - Sleep/wake notifications and reinitialization
- `WindowSnap/Core/ShortcutManager.swift` - Health checks and smart recovery
- `WindowSnap/Core/WindowManager.swift` - Accessibility validation and state management

This comprehensive solution addresses the root cause of the sleep/wake issue and provides multiple layers of protection against future problems.
