# Launch at Login Prompt - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What We've Implemented

### User-Friendly First-Run Experience
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects first-time app launches
- **Delayed Prompt**: Shows prompt 1.5 seconds after app startup for smooth UX
- **Clear Options**: Three intuitive choices for users:
  1. "Yes, Start Automatically" - Enables launch at login
  2. "No, Don't Auto-Start" - Respects user preference to disable
  3. "Decide Later" - Shows how to access preferences later
- **One-Time Experience**: Prompt only appears once per user

### Technical Implementation

#### New Files Created:
1. **`LaunchAtLoginPrompt.swift`** - Handles the user prompt and flow
2. **Demo and test scripts** for validation

#### Files Modified:
1. **`PreferencesManager.swift`** - Added first-run and prompt tracking
2. **`AppDelegate.swift`** - Integrated prompt into startup flow
3. **`StatusBarController.swift`** - Made preferences accessible
4. **Documentation** - Updated with prompt information

### Key Features

#### 🎨 User Experience
- **Non-intrusive**: Appears after app is fully loaded
- **Educational**: Explains the benefits of auto-start
- **Flexible**: Multiple ways to access preferences later
- **Respectful**: Remembers user choice and doesn't re-prompt

#### 🔧 Technical Features
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS 12+ with version-specific APIs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of permission issues
- **State Management**: Proper tracking of first-run and prompt status
- **Integration**: Seamless connection to existing preferences system

## 🚀 How to Test

### Method 1: Using the Demo Script
```bash
./demo_launch_prompt.sh
```

### Method 2: Manual Testing
```bash
# Reset app state
defaults delete com.windowsnap.app

# Run the app
cd WindowSnap && swift run

# Watch for the prompt (appears after ~1.5 seconds)
```

## 📋 User Flow

1. **First Launch**: User runs WindowSnap for the first time
2. **App Initialization**: App loads completely (menu bar icon appears)
3. **Prompt Appears**: After 1.5 seconds, friendly dialog shows
4. **User Chooses**: Select one of three clear options
5. **Action Taken**: App immediately applies the choice
6. **Confirmation**: User sees feedback about their choice
7. **Never Again**: Prompt won't show on future launches

## 🎭 Prompt Dialog Details

### Title: "Start WindowSnap automatically?"

### Message:
```
Would you like WindowSnap to start automatically when you log in to your Mac?

This ensures your window management shortcuts are always available without 
needing to manually launch the app.

You can change this setting later in Preferences.
```

### Buttons:
- **"Yes, Start Automatically"** (Default) - Enables auto-start
- **"No, Don't Auto-Start"** (Escape key) - Keeps disabled
- **"Decide Later"** - Shows preferences info

## 💡 Benefits

### For Users:
- **Discovery**: Makes the auto-start feature discoverable
- **Choice**: Gives users control over the experience
- **Education**: Explains why auto-start is useful
- **Flexibility**: Can change mind later in preferences

### For Developers:
- **Adoption**: Increases likelihood of users enabling auto-start
- **UX**: Provides smooth onboarding experience
- **Maintenance**: Self-contained and doesn't interfere with existing code
- **Analytics**: Can track how many users enable auto-start

## 🔍 Testing Scenarios Covered

1. ✅ **First-time user enables auto-start**
2. ✅ **First-time user declines auto-start**
3. ✅ **First-time user wants to decide later**
4. ✅ **Error handling when system call fails**
5. ✅ **Prompt doesn't show on subsequent launches**
6. ✅ **Integration with existing preferences system**
7. ✅ **Cross-platform compatibility (macOS 12+)**

## 📝 Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use! Users will now get a friendly prompt asking about auto-start when they first launch WindowSnap, making the feature more discoverable while respecting user choice.

To deploy:
1. Build and distribute the updated app
2. Users with existing installations won't see the prompt
3. New users will get the first-run experience
4. All users can still access preferences manually anytime
